                            <p>The little budgie bird is one of the most popular pets in the world, 
                            ranking just behind dogs and cats, and it's no wonder.</p>
                            <p>This affectionate, cute bird is small and inexpensive, and if trained 
                            properly a budgie can mimic human speech.</p>
                            <p>The origin of its formal name―budgerigar―is a mystery, but by any name, 
                            this little bird is a charming companion for most pet owners.</p>

                            <p>A cockatiel is a popular choice for a pet bird. 
                            It is a small parrot with a variety of color patterns and a head crest.</p>
                            <p>They are attractive as well as friendly. Due to their smaller size, 
                            cockatiel care and taming are easier than other parrot species.</p> 
                            <p>They are capable of mimicking speech, although they can be difficult to understand. 
                            These birds are good at whistling and you can teach them to sing along to tunes.</p>
